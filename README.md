## Weekly Schedule:
* Class starts 10:00am EST M-F, and technically ends at 6:00pm
  > Typically I will end lecture at 3:30pm EST.  You are expected to work on that day's assessment and sharpen your skills for the remainder of the day - I will stand by for office hours.
  
* **Tuesday** will be our 1-on-1 check-in days - you will have a 15 minute check-in with me, Tiffany.  If you're not scheduled to meet with me you should be working on your projects/exercises or reviewing the past QC/studying for an upcoming QC. QC's are often held on Mondays (sometimes Tuesdays).

* Every **Monday at 10:00am EST** we will begin class with a quiz :pencil2: which will last for 1 hour.  We reconvene and begin the new content for that week at 11am.
  > The Monday quizzes serve as a review for all of the material covered in the week prior.

* 1 hour lunch breaks are scheduled as follows:
  - **Monday, Thursday, Friday**: 1pm - 2pm EST
  - **Tuesday**: 12:45pm - 2pm EST
