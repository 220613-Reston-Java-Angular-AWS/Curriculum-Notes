# **Scrum**

Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.

Scrum is:

*   A framework
*   Lightweight
*   Simple to understand
*   Difficult to master

Scrum is _not_:

*   A process
*   A technique
*   A definitive method

The Scrum framework consists of Scrum Teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts, and rules.

## Scrum Theory

The roots Scrum theory are embedded in empiricism. Empiricism states that all knowledge is derived from sense-experience and our decisions should be based on what is known. Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk.

To understand Scrum it is important to understand how the framework implements the three pillars of empirical process control:

*   Transparency
*   Inspection
*   Adaptation


#### Transparency

This means that the important aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome. The way that we can accomplish this in Scrum:

*   A common language referring to the process which is shared by all participants
*   All participants share a common definition of what "done" means.


#### Inspection


Scrum teams must frequently assess the framework's artifacts and overall progress towards a goal to detect undesirable variances. This inspection process should not be so frequent that inspection gets in the way of work.


#### Adaptation

In the event that the rate of our progress, or retrospection on a previous sprint, is unsatisfactory, the framework provides mechanisms that help teams adjust any processes related to those goals, which helps to minimize further deviation. Scrum has four formal events that help teams inspect their processes and adapt to change:

*   Sprint Planning
*   Daily Scrum
*   Sprint Review
*   Sprint Retrospective

## Scrum Values

Each member of a Scrum Team must embody the five values:

*   Commitment (to achieving the goals of the Scrum Team)
*   Courage (to do the right thing and work on tough problems)
*   Focus (on the work of the Sprint and the goals of the Scrum Team)
*   Openness (about all the work and the challenges with performing the work)
*   Respect (for other members as capable and independent people)


## Scrum Team Structure

*   The Product Owner
*   The Development Team
*   Scrum Master

#### The Product Owner


The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from work of the Development Team. How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals.

The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog. Product Backlog management includes:


*   Clearly expressing Product Backlog items;
*   Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions;
*   Optimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs;
*   Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next; and,
*   Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed.

The Product Owner may do the above work, or have the Development Team do it. However, the Product Owner remains accountable.

The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the desires of a committee in the Product Backlog, but those wanting to change a Product Backlog item’s priority must address the Product Owner.

For the Product Owner to succeed, the entire organization must respect his or her decisions. The Product Owner’s decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog. No one can force the Development Team to work from a different set of requirements.


#### The Development Team

The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable Increment of "Done" product at the end of each Sprint. A "Done" increment is required at the Sprint Review. Only members of the Development Team create the Increment.

Development Teams are structured and empowered by the organization to organize and manage their own work. The resulting synergy optimizes the Development Team’s overall efficiency and effectiveness.

Development Teams have the following characteristics:


*   They are self-organizing. No one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the Development Team how to turn Product Backlog into Increments of potentially releasable functionality;
*   Development Teams are cross-functional, with all the skills as a team necessary to create a product Increment;
*   Scrum recognizes no titles for Development Team members, regardless of the work being performed by the person;
*   Scrum recognizes no sub-teams in the Development Team, regardless of domains that need to be addressed like testing, architecture, operations, or business analysis; and,
*   Individual Development Team members may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but accountability belongs to the Development Team as a whole.

#### Scrum Master

The Scrum Master is responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. Scrum Masters do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values.

The Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team. The Scrum Master helps those outside the Scrum Team understand which of their interactions with the Scrum Team are helpful and which aren’t. The Scrum Master helps everyone change these interactions to maximize the value created by the Scrum Team.


##### Scrum Master Service to the Product Owner

The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner in several ways, including:



*   Ensuring that goals, scope, and product domain are understood by everyone on the Scrum Team as well as possible
*   Finding techniques for effective Product Backlog management
*   Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items
*   Understanding product planning in an empirical environment
*   Ensuring the Product Owner knows how to arrange the Product Backlog to maximize value
*   Understanding and practicing agility
*   Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed

##### Scrum Master Service to the Development Team


The Scrum Master serves the Development Team in several ways, including:

*   Coaching the Development Team in self-organization and cross-functionality
*   Helping the Development Team to create high-value products
*   Removing impediments to the Development Team’s progress
*   Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed
*   Coaching the Development Team in organizational environments in which Scrum is not yet fully adopted and understood.

##### Scrum Master Service to the Organization


The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including:

*   Leading and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption
*   Planning Scrum implementations within the organization
*   Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact Scrum and empirical product development
*   Causing change that increases the productivity of the Scrum Team
*   Working with other Scrum Masters to increase the effectiveness of the application of Scrum in the organization.

## Scrum Events

There are well-defined events in the Scrum framework that create a routine for the team to follow while also minimizing the need for meetings. All events have a maximum duration that must be adhered to, it cannot be shortened or lengthened:

*   The Sprint
*   Sprint Planning
*   Daily Scrum
*   Sprint Review
*   Sprint Retrospective

##### The Sprint


The heart of Scrum is a Sprint, a time-box of one month or less during which a "Done", useable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created. Sprints have consistent durations throughout a development effort. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.

Sprints contain and consist of the Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, the development work, the Sprint Review, and the Sprint Retrospective.

During the Sprint:

*   No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;
*   Quality goals do not decrease; and,
*   Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned.

Duration: Maximum of 1 month


##### Sprint Planning

The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the Sprint Planning. This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.

The purpose of Sprint Planning is to answer the following questions:

*   What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
*   How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?

Duration: Two hours for each week of the Sprint (1 week Sprint = 2-hour meeting, 2 week Sprint = 4-hour meeting, etc.)


##### Daily Scrum

The Daily Scrum is held every day of the Sprint. At it, the Development Team plans work for the next 24 hours. This optimizes team collaboration and performance by inspecting the work since the last Daily Scrum and forecasting upcoming Sprint work. The Daily Scrum is held at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity.

The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to:

*   Inspect progress towards the Sprint Goal
*   Inspect how progress is trending toward completing the work in the Sprint Backlog

Duration: 15-minutes


##### Sprint Review

A Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint. Based on that and any changes to the Product Backlog during the Sprint, attendees collaborate on the next things that could be done to optimize value. This is an informal meeting, not a status meeting, and the presentation of the Increment is intended to elicit feedback and foster collaboration.

Duration: One hour for each week of the Sprint (1 week Sprint = 1-hour meeting, 2 week Sprint = 2-hour meeting, etc.)


##### Sprint Retrospective

The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint. It occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning.

The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to:

*   Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools
*   Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements
*   Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work

## Sprint Artifacts

Scrum’s artifacts represent work or value to provide transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation. Artifacts defined by Scrum are specifically designed to maximize transparency of key information so that everybody has the same understanding of the artifact.

The following a core artifacts to the Scrum framework:

*   Product Backlog
*   Sprint Backlog
*   Increment

##### Product Backlog


The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. It is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product. The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog, including its content, availability, and ordering.


##### Sprint Backlog

The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Backlog is a forecast by the Development Team about what functionality will be in the next Increment and the work needed to deliver that functionality into a "Done" Increment.


##### Increment

The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints. At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be "Done," which means it must be in useable condition and meet the Scrum Team’s definition of "Done". An increment is a body of inspectable, done work that supports empiricism at the end of the Sprint. The increment is a step toward a vision or goal. The increment must be in useable condition regardless of whether the Product Owner decides to release it.
