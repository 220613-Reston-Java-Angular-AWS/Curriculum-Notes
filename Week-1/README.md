## OS: Operating Systems - Fundamentals 

![](./../images/operating-system-intro.png)

An OS, or operating system, is the software that allows you to interface with your computer. It takes care of managing the different parts of your computer, such as hardware, memory, and processes. Some common operating systems are Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux, but mobile operating systems like Android and iOS are also part of this category.

Windows is the most popular operating system, primarily because it comes pre-installed on PCs and is fairly easy to use. Similarly, macOS comes pre-installed on Mac (Apple) computers. Linux is most commonly found on servers, though it can be installed on personal computers as well, and it is an open-source operating system with many different distributions that differ slightly from each other (such as Debian and Red Hat Linux).

## Unix

Unix is a family of operating systems that derive from one built in the 1970s at Bell Labs by AT&T. The current owner of the Unix license is The Open Group, however, Novell, Inc currently holds the copyrights. Linux operating systems and OS X operating systems are based on Unix. One of Unix's standard features is the command-line shell that is used to interface with the operating system. In Linux, this shell is commonly Bash.

 **Bash
The Bourne Again Shell or Bash is based on the original Unix shell, which was called sh. Bash is compatible with sh and incorporates other features as well. Bash was created in 1989.**

## Commands

### Through the tutorial above we will pratice writing and executing commands in the terminal, however, [here](https://github.com/220613-Reston-Java-Angular-AWS/Curriculum-Notes/blob/main/Week-1/commands.md). is a breakdown of more commands 



## Command-Line Text Editors

You can write/view files in the shell by making use of built-in text editors such as `nano` and `vim` or `vi`.
