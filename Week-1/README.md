## OS: Operating Systems - Fundamentals 

![](./../images/operating-system-intro.png)

An OS, or operating system, is the software that allows you to interface with your computer. It takes care of managing the different parts of your computer, such as hardware, memory, and processes. Some common operating systems are Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux, but mobile operating systems like Android and iOS are also part of this category.

Windows is the most popular operating system, primarily because it comes pre-installed on PCs and is fairly easy to use. Similarly, macOS comes pre-installed on Mac (Apple) computers. Linux is most commonly found on servers, though it can be installed on personal computers as well, and it is an open-source operating system with many different distributions that differ slightly from each other (such as Debian and Red Hat Linux).
