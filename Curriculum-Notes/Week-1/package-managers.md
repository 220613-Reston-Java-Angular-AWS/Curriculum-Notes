# Package Managers

Package managers are a type of software that you can use to manage installations and updates for other software on your machine. Typically they allow you to use a CLI (command line interface) to install and update your software. This means that you can easily run commands to install things like Git, Java, .NET, Docker, and more. There are a variety of different package managers, many of which are specific to the operating system that you're using.

- Common Windows package managers:
    - [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/)
    - [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)
- Common Linux package managers:
    - APT (Debian Linux)
    - YUM (Red Hat Linux)
- Common macOS package managers:
