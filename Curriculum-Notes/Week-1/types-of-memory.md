# Types of Memory

An important part of computers is their memory. A computer's memory is essentially storage for any information that it might need to come back to, whether that is individual bits that a program is referencing, or entire files that you want to open. An obvious example might be when you save a document that you're working on - that document needs to be stored in memory. However, on a smaller scale, some code that you write might need to store a boolean value (true or false) so that it can determine whether it needs to do something else just a few moments later.

Because there are so many different uses for memory on a computer, there are different types of memory. These different types allow everything to run more efficiently, as you can have certain types that are better at doing certain things. Here, we will talk about a few of those types.

## Internal Memory

Internal memory, or primary memory, consists of the memory that your computer can easily access while you're using it. Internal memory, as the name suggests, is connected directly to your computer, and includes two types: RAM and ROM.

- RAM, or random access memory, is used by the CPU for temporary data. This is anything that software on your computer might use while it's running, but that it doesn't need to save long-term. Because software utilizes RAM while it runs, the amount of RAM that you have affects the speed/performance of your computer - if you have a larger amount of RAM, your computer can do a lot more multitasking because it has the storage to spare. RAM also is volatile, meaning that when your computer shuts off, the storage is cleared - nothing is saved.

- ROM, or read-only memory, is used for permanent storage. The name tells you a lot about it - ROM is "read-only", meaning that you can read the memory, but once data is stored there, it cannot be changed. ROM is non-volatile, so it persists after your computer shuts off.

## External Memory

External memory, or secondary memory, includes things like external hard drives, flash drives, and memory cards, which are not directly connected to the CPU (can be removed). This can be used for easily transferring data from one computer to another. External memory, of course, is non-volatile, and data is written to this storage after being passed through your computer's RAM and processed by the CPU.
