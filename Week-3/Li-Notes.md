# WEEK 3 NOTES

## AWS (AMAZON WEB SERVICES)
- Cloud computing: on-demand delivery of computing power, database storage, applications and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Provides a simple way to access servers, stroage, databases and a broad set of application services over the Internet.

### SIX Advantages of Cloud Computing
1. Trade capital expense for variable expense.
- Only pay when consuming computing resources and how much you consume versus initial outlay into data centers and servers.
2. Benefit from massive economies of scale.
- Achieve lower variable cost because usage is aggregated in the cloud, higher economies of scale for the providers translate to lower pay-as-you-go prices.
3. Stop guessing about capacity.
- In regards to infrastructure, usually a company will have idle expensive resources or limited capacity issues.
4. Increase speed and agility.
- New IT resources are only a few clicks away, so the resources can be available in minutes versus waiting for weeks.
5. Eliminate overhead cost of maintaining data centers.
- Focus can shift to the real customers (end users) instead of instrafrastructure.
6. Go global in minutes.
- Deployment across the multiple regions is achievalble with a few clicks. This provides a better experience for the end user at a minimal cost.

### Paying for Cloud Services
AWS offers pay-as-you-go for 160+ cloud services. Only pay for the individual services needed, for as long as you use them, with no long-term contracts or complex licensing.

## 3 MODELS OF CLOUD COMPUTING
1. `Infrastructure as a Service` (IaaS) : self-services model for managing remote data center infrastructures. (i.e. AWS has data centers.)
2. `Platform as a Service` (PaaS) : organizations can build, run and manage applications without the IT infrastructure. Enables an easier and quicker method of development, testing, and deployment of applications.
3. `Software as a Service` (SaaS) : replaces traditional on-device software that is licensed on a subscription basis, which hosted centrally on the cloud. (i.e. Salesforce)
